= Using Chaos to Bring Resiliency to your Java applications in Kubernetes

Chaos Engineering takes the complexity of a distriubuted system and test it holistically by simulating turbulent conditions and observing how the system responds and performs. The data collected allows to build more resilient applications. This talk will provide a quick introduction to the principles of Chaos Engineering. It will then introduce a Java application built using microservices deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. Majority of the talk will focus on how to perform Chaos Engineering experiments, collect data, identify the weakness and fix the system. Attendees will learn different tools like Gremlin, Istio and ChaosToolkit and how to conduct experiments using them. You'll walk away with fully working code samples.
