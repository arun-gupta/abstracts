= The Serverless Tidal Wave

Since AWS created Lambda in 2014, serverless computing has taken off as one of the preeminent technologies driving cloud adoption and modern applications. Serverless is predicated on the simple mantra: never manage servers. In this talk, we’ll reflect on why AWS decided to launch Lambda, our serverless functions-as-a-service compute offering. We’ll then take a look at the broader ecosystem and the myriad of serverless offerings that have been created since then. Today, serverless has grown to be more than just AWS Lambda. Container technologies have evolved to bring developers the same serverless benefits – never manage clusters. Just write code. As the serverless landscape evolves rapidly, we’ll dig into what’s coming next. Is orchestration still relevant in this new paradigm? How will serverless fundamentally change the way we think about application architecture and where do we see the next wave of innovation?
