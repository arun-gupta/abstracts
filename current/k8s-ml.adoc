= Containerized Machine Learning using Kubeflow and Kubernetes

Kubeflow provides a containerized machine learning platform. It makes deployment of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. It has components like Jupyter notebook that makes it easy for data scientist to start with training and inference. Models can be trained using TensorFlow and other frameworks. KFServing is an abstraction for common ML frameworks like TensorFlow, XGBoost, PyTorch and others. Pipelines provides an end-to-end ML orchestration, easy experimentation, and reuse. Scalable and flexible hyperparameter tuning is provided by Katib. This talk will provide an introduction to Kubeflow, Kubernetes cluster topology for ML, how to run ML workloads using Kubeflow, and demonstrate how to use different components. Attendees will leave with a GitHub repo of fully working samples.


= Using Kubernetes for Machine Learning Frameworks

Kubernetes provides isolation, auto-scaling, load balancing, flexibility and GPU support. These features are critical to run computationally, data intensive and hard to parallelize machine learning models. Declarative syntax of Kubernetes deployment descriptors make it easy for non-operationally focused engineers to easily train machine learning models on Kubernetes. This talk will explain why and how Kubernetes is well suited for single and multi node distributed training, deploying your machine learning models in production and setting up visualization tools like TensorBoard for monitoring. Specifically it will show how to setup a variety of open source machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Apache MXNet and Pytorch on a Kubernetes cluster. The attendees will learn distributed training, massaging and inference phases of setting up a Machine Learning framework on Kubernetes. Attendees will leave with a GitHub repo of fully working samples.
