= Building Modern Applications using Open Source

At Amazon, we innovate on behalf of our customers so that they don’t have to do undifferentiated heavylifting and can focus on their applications. We are innovating at different layers of the stack – containers, microservices and virtualization. We also know that Open Source is important to them, and so it matters to us. As we’re innovating with our services, we are making sure to maintain upstream compatibility. This talk will explain how we're innovating in the open source for our customers. Specifically, it will explain how Amazon EKS team is contributing to Kubernetes in open source. Then it will talk about how we've built an Envoy-based control plane to enable customers deploy service mesh at scale. Finally, attendees will learn about how Firecracker provides a  strong hardware-virtualization-based security and workload isolation of VM with a combination of fast start times and high density of containers.
