= Crash, burn, and recover Kubernetes cluster and apps

Your Kubernetes application is running well, and then all of a sudden the service stops responding. How do you debug? You created a deployment but its not coming up. Does your pod status is shown pending? How do you debug deployments and pods, get their logs, see the filesystem layout? Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is not scaling pods. Is your cluster running out of capacity? Or are the metrics not available? Having DNS lookup failures for services? Does your PVC status shows pending? Is kubectl not able to find nodes? This session will be loaded with different ways your applications on k8s crash and burn, and more importantly how do you recover from them.
