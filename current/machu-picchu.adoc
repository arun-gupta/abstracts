= Machu Picchu Ignite

Summer 2018 was very exciting when I went on a trek to one of the seven wonders of the world - Machu Picchu in Peru. Trekking 26 miles between 9k - 13k ft elevation for 4 days, eating exotic food, seeing all different weather, waking up at 3am, and being with friends that I've known for 20-+ years. It was an absolute blast!
