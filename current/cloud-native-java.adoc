= Continuous Development of Cloud Native Java Applications on Kubernetes

Applications packaged as containers, dynamically managed using an orchestration process and following the microservices approach are basic principles of a cloud native application. Build, test and deployment of such an application can be overwhelming for an existing Java developer. This session will introduce tools like Draft and Skaffold that provides a seamless integration with your application development lifecycle on Kubernetes. The attendees will learn how to do continuous development of a Java application. The workflow will show how you can do rapid development, test and debug of the application on your desktop and then deploy such an application to a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud. Observability and monitoring will be discussed.
