= Java developer's journey in Kubernetes land

This will be a code-only session, possibly with an interactive dialog.

- Show a Java application with three microservices (can use https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-compute-options/tree/master/services)
- How this application is packaged as a Docker image
- Create Kubernetes manifests
- How Helm charts are created
- Test in a local environment such as minikube
- Attach debugger (may need to find out if tooling exists in this area)
- Install Istio in k8s, show service visibility
- Install k8s on AWS
- Migrate application from a local cluster to a cluster on AWS
- Deployment pipeline using CodePipeline
- Use an Alexa skill to scale the application
- Change application, show A/B using Istio
