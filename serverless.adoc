= Serverless Architecture Patterns and Best Practices

Serverless computing allows you to build and run applications without the need for provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda has changed how developers build and run their applications or services. But what are the best practices for tasks such as deployment, monitoring, and debugging in a serverless world? In this session, we’ll dive into best practices that serverless developers can use for application lifecycle management, CI/CD, monitoring, and diagnostics. We’ll talk about how you can build CI/CD pipelines that automatically build, test, and deploy your serverless applications using AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CloudFormation. We’ll also cover the built-in capabilities of Lambda and API Gateway for creating multiple versions, stages, and environments of your functions and APIs. Finally, we’ll cover monitoring and diagnostics of your Lambda functions with Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray.
